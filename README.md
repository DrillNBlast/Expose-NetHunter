# Expose NetHunter

This project will expose the underbelly of NetHunter (and, in part, Kali) to
web developers.

## Why?

Info sec tools are plagued by bad design. Even NetHunter, the supposed "easy
way", has numerous UI glitches, difficult to understand menu systems, poorly
defined config panels, and the lack of an easy to develop, modular extension
architecture.

Meanwhile, web tech has grown far faster than anyone in the info sec community
seems to fully realize. Considering the severe lack of UI/UX design for the
existing tools, it's no wonder that the industries are so separate.


## How does this work?

This runs on Node.js and hosts a web-based front end for various nethunter
tools. That means you need to have nodejs on your mobile device... but since it
comes with nethunter, we're in luck out of the box.

I'll get back to this. I want tooling NOW.
